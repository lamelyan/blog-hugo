People in the tech industry are often criticized for their lack of "soft skills."
I don't know about other industries, but working in tech, 
I find this to be true and I'm not immune to this either.

A common example of this are online forums (ex: StackOverflow), 
where developers may swiftly mark your question for closure or down vote it.
You're lucky if they specify the reason for their decision.

However, amidst this, I've found that some community members are helpful 
and eager to answer questions. This is particularly true for those people 
whose products you are using. Perhaps they have an incentive to see you 
succeed with their product, or maybe they're just generally helpful.

In any case, it's surprising how often key contributors to open-source 
projects respond, and usually quite promptly. Shoutout to 
[Oscar Dudycz](https://event-driven.io/en/) and [Jeremy Miller](https://jeremydmiller.com/)

While at first reluctant to ask these guys questions on GitHub or Discord, thinking "I'm not worthy" of taking up their time, they took their time and guided me to a solution.

Moral of the story: Don't be afraid to reach out for guidance. Look for the project's GitHub page and ask there. Create an issue, or check if they have a Discussion section. Some more ambitious projects even have a Discord channel.
