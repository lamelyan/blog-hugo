What is up with this epidemic of multiple tabs. I am not refering to two or three tabs open. 
I've seen people have over twenty tabs open. And it's not a one-off situation. It's a permanent condition. 
When I ask why they need all these tabs. The answer is usually 

"It's to remind me that I to get this done."
or 
"I might this for later"


Sometimes these tabs are open for weeks! 

It's a common issue:

All these open tabs produce cognitive load. It takes mental energy to keep track of multiple things at once.

To me, this is a symptom of something broken in the research process. 

Most of the R&D process is to learn different ways of solving the problem. 

Unless you plan to keep everything in your head, it's a good idea to write stuff down.

Scan the page, copy/paste what is relevant into the note app, copy a link into notes for reference, close tab. 

In recent years, browsers have introduced the features that would help one to manage tabs.
They let you organize tabs into "groups" or "work spaces". 

That is helpful, however, that's just helps to manage chaos a bit. The tabs will come back to haunt you. 

Another reason to keep notes, is that it forces you to think about where you were and where you are going. 
You might not need to open another tab because, while summorizing previous tab, you've come up 
with a different solution while summarizing your notes.
