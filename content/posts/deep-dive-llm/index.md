# Breakdown: Understanding LLMs

## 1. [Introduction (0:00 - 1:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=0s)

### What are LLMs?
Karpathy begins by explaining what large language models (LLMs) are, highlighting their capabilities and limitations. He also sets the goal of the session: to provide a comprehensive understanding of LLMs for a general audience.

---

## 2. [Pre-training Stage (1:04 - 2:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=64s)

- **Downloading and processing the internet**  
  This part explores how massive amounts of text data are collected from the internet and cleaned for model training.

- **The FineWeb data set**  
  Karpathy uses the FineWeb data set to demonstrate the scale and complexity of preparing web data.

- **Tokenization**  
  Tokenization is introduced as the process of breaking text into smaller units (tokens) that the model can process.

---

## 3. [Building the Base Model (2:53 - 43:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=173s)

- **Training on tokens**  
  Karpathy illustrates how the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence using simple word prediction examples.

- **Neural network architecture**  
  He introduces the transformer architecture and explains how it powers modern LLMs.

- **The base model**  
  This part highlights how the base model becomes an internet text simulator—able to generate realistic text, but not yet able to respond meaningfully to queries.

---

## 4. [Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (43:07 - 1:15:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=2587s)

- **Turning the base model into an assistant**  
  Karpathy explains how supervised fine-tuning helps shape the model into a helpful assistant by training it on curated conversations.

- **Human labelers**  
  The role of human annotators is emphasized in creating high-quality training data.

- **Conversation encoding**  
  Conversations are represented as token sequences, allowing the model to learn from them.

- **Programming by example**  
  The model learns by example, emulating the responses provided by human labelers.

---

## 5. [LLM Psychology (1:15:00 - 1:40:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=4500s)

- **Hallucinations**  
  Karpathy dives into hallucinations—cases where LLMs generate incorrect info—and explains the root causes.

- **The knowledge of self**  
  He discusses the model’s lack of true self-awareness or identity.

- **Context windows**  
  The concept of a context window is compared to human working memory, helping to explain how LLMs retain relevant information.

---

## 6. [Reinforcement Learning (RL) (1:40:01 - 2:14:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=6001s)

- **Improving LLMs' abilities**  
  Karpathy introduces reinforcement learning as the third stage of LLM training, used to sharpen model performance.

- **School analogy**  
  He compares this process to a student going to school and being graded.

- **Emergent properties**  
  He highlights surprising and complex behaviors that can emerge from RL-based training.

---

## 7. [Summary and Future Capabilities (2:14:20 - 3:15:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=8060s)

- **The three stages of LLM training**  
  A summary of the full LLM training lifecycle: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

- **Multimodality**  
  Karpathy discusses how future LLMs will handle multiple data types—text, audio, images—for richer interaction.

- **Agents**  
  He introduces the idea of persistent LLM agents capable of working over longer timeframes.

---

## 8. [Resources (3:15:05 - 3:21:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=11705s)

- **LM leaderboard (Hugging Face)**  
  Karpathy recommends Hugging Face’s leaderboard for tracking LLM performance.

- **LM Studio**  
  A local app that lets users explore and experiment with LLMs.

---

## 9. [Conclusion (3:21:43 - 3:31:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI&t=12043s)

- **Using LLMs as tools**  
  Karpathy closes by emphasizing responsible use of LLMs—understanding their limits and verifying their outputs.
