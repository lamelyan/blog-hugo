## My path
As a freshman in college, I was uncertain about my future path.
Hearing about the potential demand for software developers, I opted for the Computer Science route.
Initially challenging, I contemplated switching majors.

However, for extra credit, I joined a project helping a professor build a basic data capture and analysis system. 
It was a simple app with data entry forms and grids, but it showed me how software could be used to solve real problems. That experience put things into perspective for me, and I stuck with it.

Since then, I’ve focused on solving problems through software. 
My career has taken me across industries like Travel, Law, Technology, and Logistics, 
where I’ve built systems including ERP, CRM, document management, and automation tools.
